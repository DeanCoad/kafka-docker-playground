# Differences between Confluent Cloud UI and local Control Center connected to Confluent Cloud

**Notes**:

* if the cluster is [VPC peered](https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/vpc.html), we assume that [Configuring Access to the UI Dashboard](https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/vpc.html#configuring-access-to-the-ui-dashboard) has been setup, otherwise Topics, Consumers and KSQL tabs will be empty and show a banner to setup proxy.

* Cloud UI is evolving a lot, the screenshots shown below were accurate only at the time they were published, i.e Nov, 19th 2019.
