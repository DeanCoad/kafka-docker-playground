# Multi Data Center and single views

## Description

This is the very good example from [MDC and single views üåç](https://github.com/framiere/mdc-with-replicator-and-regexrouter)

We have 2 regions: `US` and `EUROPE` each have a topic with sales that happened regionaly.
We want on each region to have a way to see **all** sales in **all** regions.
